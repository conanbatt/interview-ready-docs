## The Theory & Practice

### General Programming üé•

- Functions
    - Declarative Naming
        - Name must imply side-effects if it has any (i.e. getValue changes the value
    - Named Parameters
    - Co-Location
    - Size
        - Avoid overuse of small functions. ‚ÄúRule of 3‚Äù
    - ‚ÄúDo one thing‚Äù
    - Avoid side-effects
- Variables & Control flow
    - Declarative Variable Naming
    - Avoid Magic Numbers
    - Avoid comments - code as documentation
    - Avoid while loops
    - Avoid large Conditional clauses
    - Variable scoping
    - Do not modify inputs
    - Cyclomatic Complexity
        - Early returns
        - Reduced boolean nexting
- General Programming
    - DRY & Leaky Abstractions
    - Elegance & Taste
    - Atomicity
    - General over special case implementation
    - Error handling
        - Defensive programming
        - Invariant programming
        - Error Management
            - Catch what you can handle
            - Do not eat errors
            - Re-throw errors only if useful
    - Cohesion vs dependency
    - Developer Context & Colocation
        - File sizes
        - Componentization vs Separation of Concerns

### Paradigmas

- Functional, Object, Imperative, Declarative
    - Imperative programming is about sequentially giving instructions to a computer
        - Globally scoped commands and variables
        - Sequential execution
        - No abstractions
        - Very common in scripting
    - Declarative is a way to write based on what you want to achieve
        - It is mainly just a naming difference to an imperative programming
    - OOP is good for complex systems that manage both state and behavior
    - Functional programming
        - Referential transparency
            - Functions don‚Äôt have side-effects
            - They always return the same on the same inputs
        - Function composition and ‚Äúwrapping‚Äù (High order functions)
- OOP tips
    - Naming
    - Separation of concerns
    - Privacy
    - Reaching invalid states
    - Composition over inheritance
